# Overview

## A Unity game that I created to learn basic C# and Unity functions. The game features a menu screen where the player can start the game. From there it shows a scene witha  bowl and several tic-tac shaped objects with faces on them. It starts to play music and the player controls one of the tic-tacs and moves around through jumping (spacebar) and horizontal movement (A+D). The other tic-tacs are computers and move freely (jumping up and down randomly). There's nothing more to it. I wanted the game to have a small scope just to get my feet wet and understand the work flow with Unity. From this I have a better understanding of Object-Oriented programming. I also have a lot more confidene in learning unfamiliar technologies.
